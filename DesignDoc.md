# Mutation Prediction Design Doc 
Group project for COMP 383/483 - mutation prediction for viral proteomes with Dr. Whelton Miller. 
## Overview
Viruses mutate extremely frequently, their mutation rate being higher than any other organism. Their ability to quickly evolve has lead to efficient infection of their host, evading antiviral drugs. Due to this characteristic, it has proven difficult to hault the spread of a virus, as seen with the spread of Sars-Cov-2. There is an urgent demand for the accurate predictive tools for viral mutations in order to get ahead of the virus and stop the spread prior to mutation. A previous group has worked with Dr. Miller to create a machine learning model for mutation prediction. However, the current model is fit for only the Sars-Cov-2 virus. We aim to expand this model to fit other viruses; Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Bar virus (EBV).

## Context

## Goals & Non-Goals
Our main goal is to further develop a prediction mutation tool for viral proteomes by expanding the pre-existing model, which focuses only on the Sars-Cov-2 virus, to be generalized to more viruses, such as HPV and EBV. 
- Goals
  - Overall goal: adjust the current model to be applicable for various viruses by training the model with new proteomes and adjusting the parameters to improve accuracy
  - Obtain the mutations that are most likely biologically significant
  - Make the current tool more user-friendly
 
- Non-Goals
  - We will not be worrying about the quantity of mutation predictions returned, but rather the quality / accuracy of the mutation predictions
  - During the retrival of proteomes, we won't concern ourselves with different virus variants
